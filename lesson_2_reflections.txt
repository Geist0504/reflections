What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It sets up a file for git intreaction instructions. 
This allows git to connect with the files in the directory and manipulate them


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory - The area we are operating on. All files don't necessarily have to be a part of the same repository and some might not be touched by Git

Staging area - the place were a change is first undertaken but before it is comitted to the repository

Repository - the area that stores all git files.

The value of separating these out is the ability to be deliberate with individual files and treat them in a variety of different ways
