When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I think you would want to do so whenever you wanted public access for collaboration/viewing/using purposes. Local should be reserved for more private or confidential uses


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For similar reasons that you want to manually commit changes vs automatically do so.
It allows for more deliberate and effective change management
Also it allows you tigheter control over what code is made public and what isn't


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks - A clone of another github repository on github which allows modification by a second user and links back to the first repository but doesn't change it. Used to modify something that will continue to exist

Clones are duplications locally from another local or cloud place which allows modification by a new user. Does not link back to original sources and track changes. Used to start something new

Branch - a deviation from a development path. Used to modify somapability etc.)ething (add a new feature, c)
