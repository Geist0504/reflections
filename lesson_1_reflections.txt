How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped because I could go line by line and spot what didn't match.

I appreciated having the attention grabbing + and - 
but think there could be more done to call attention to differences


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It could assist with debugging, when a feature previously worked and now didn't you could mroe easily investiage


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro = Will usually be meaningful & intentional
Con = relies on human judgement and habit, which can be fallible


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think it depends on the goals 

Certain files will have limited interdependence and exist largely on their own. Only their changes matter

Others will rely on information from other files, therefore changes in one may affect the other, so tracking all through time is important


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Log can show you the histor of all the changes
Diff can show you the differences between two logged versions


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

VC will allow you to have saved stable versions that you can easily return to if something breaks. Insurance


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I don't really know what I want to use Git for
I want to see how it works in web development and try coding on the machine vs in browser
